# Vehicle management
 
The traffic department wants to automate the process of detecting traffic violations, such as speeding, illegal parking or running red lights. Once a violation is detected, the system should issue a ticket to the vehicle owner based on the type of violation.

Implement procedures to detect different types of traffic violations 

Automatically impose fines based on the type and severity of the violation.

 Key point: The system should distinguish between different types of violations and have different configurable actions for each type. Consider implementing functionality to notify vehicle owners via email, assuming that email addresses exist in a given dataset.
