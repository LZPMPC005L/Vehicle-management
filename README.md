# Vehicle management
 
In order to optimise urban traffic, the department would like to analyse the flow of vehicles at different times of the day and identify areas prone to congestion. The system should provide insights to help manage and reduce traffic congestion.

Implementing a function to analyse the number of vehicles passing through a city intersection at different times of day

Identify areas prone to congestion based on traffic flow data.

Key point: consider using data visualisation tools to represent traffic flows and congestion patterns.In addition, implement algorithms to predict congestion times and suggest alternative routes to drivers via email when congestion is detected.
