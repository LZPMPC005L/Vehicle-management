# Vehicle management
 
In order to optimise urban traffic, the department would like to analyse the flow of vehicles at different times of the day and identify areas prone to congestion. The system should provide insights to help manage and reduce traffic congestion.

Implementing a function to analyse the number of vehicles passing through a city intersection at different times of day

Identify areas prone to congestion based on traffic flow data.

There exists a RECORD function in this system to record the licence plate number and then send email notifications to other drivers once a particular vehicle like 120 is spotted at a particular intersection. Once a special vehicle like the 120 is spotted at a certain intersection, an email notification is sent to other drivers.
