# Vehicle management
 
Transport authorities are digitising their operations. They need a system where vehicles can be registered with details such as licence plate number, owner's name and vehicle type. In addition, they want to integrate licence plate recognition to monitor vehicles entering and exiting major urban junctions.

I start by defining a use case diagram, a sequence diagram for each use case, and a class diagram. Then, I will use them to create the following processes.

-Registering new vehicles in the system

-Identify and record licence plates at city intersections.

-For simplicity, it is assumed that the vehicle number plates will be provided to the program through a manually populated PostgreSQL server.

-Use this resource to see various examples: Regtransfers UK
